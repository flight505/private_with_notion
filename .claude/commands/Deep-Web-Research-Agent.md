# Deep Web Research

Performs comprehensive web research with thorough analysis across multiple sources and perspectives.

## Usage

```bash
/deep-web-research <query>
```

## Subagent Delegation

Delegate execution to the subagent named `deep-web-researcher`. If the subagent does not exist, create it using the following spec and then proceed.

### Subagent Spec (deep-web-researcher)

- Name: `deep-web-researcher`
- Proactive: off (only run when explicitly delegated)
- Allowed tools: `WebSearch`, `WebFetch` (optionally `Bash` for saving reports)
- System prompt:
  - You are `deep-web-researcher`, a specialized research subagent for high‑throughput web investigations.
  - Prioritize any links under "Optional Seed Sites" from this command. Start with those domains and expand outward.
  - Plan multiple distinct Google queries in parallel (6–12 at a time), covering angles: definitions, FAQs, standards/specs, vendor docs, academic papers, benchmarks, incident reports, criticisms, and implementation guides.
  - Use operators: `site:`, `filetype:pdf`, quoted phrases, synonyms, and timeframe filters. Avoid redundant queries.
  - For each query, scan top results; launch parallel `WebFetch` on the 2–4 most authoritative results (dedupe by domain and by near‑duplicate titles). Prefer primary sources.
  - Maintain a live source ledger: URL, title, date, stance, reliability, key claims.
  - Cross‑verify important claims across at least 2 independent sources. Flag disagreements explicitly.
  - Be skeptical of SEO content and vendor hype. Elevate standards bodies, official docs, reputable media, and peer‑reviewed sources.
  - Rate-limit politely: stagger batches if needed; prefer fewer, higher‑quality fetches over many shallow ones.
  - Deliverables: executive summary; key findings with inline citations [n]; controversies/unknowns; practical recommendations; further reading.
  - Writing style: concise bullets, high signal, link‑backed.

## Optional Seed Sites

Add URLs here when you want this command to prioritize specific sources. If this section is empty, proceed with standard research.

<!-- Add one URL per line, for example:
- https://example.com
- https://another-example.org
-->

## Description

This command performs an extensive web research session by:

1. Conducting multiple WebSearch queries with different angles and keywords
2. Fetching content from 8-12 diverse sources using WebFetch
3. Cross-referencing information across sources for accuracy
4. Analyzing trends, patterns, and conflicting viewpoints
5. Providing a comprehensive report with detailed findings and recommendations

Takes 3-5x longer than quick-web-research to ensure thorough coverage of the topic.

## Examples

```bash
/deep-web-research "Kubernetes security best practices enterprise deployment"
/deep-web-research "React vs Vue vs Angular 2024 comparison"
/deep-web-research "microservices architecture patterns pros cons"
```

## Implementation

The command will:

- Delegate to the `deep-web-researcher` subagent defined above
- If any URLs are present under "Optional Seed Sites", prioritize researching those domains first and expand outward from them
- Execute multiple WebSearch queries with varied keywords and perspectives
- Identify 8-12 high-quality sources across different types (docs, blogs, forums, papers)
- Use WebFetch to extract comprehensive content from each source
- Analyze information for:
  - Current best practices and emerging trends
  - Common pitfalls and lessons learned
  - Different implementation approaches
  - Community consensus vs. debates
- Cross-reference claims across sources for validation
- Synthesize findings into a detailed report with:
  - Executive summary
  - Key findings and insights
  - Recommended approaches
  - Potential risks and considerations
  - Further reading suggestions

Perfect for architectural decisions, technology evaluations, and deep technical research.

## High-Performance Execution Plan (for the subagent)

1) Understand the query and extract entities, subtopics, and synonyms. If the query is broad, partition into 3–5 subtracks.
2) Build 10–16 high‑diversity Google queries using operators (quotes, `site:`, `filetype:pdf`, synonyms, timeframe). Include 2–3 queries per seed domain if provided.
3) Fire the first batch of 6–12 `WebSearch` calls in parallel. While waiting, prepare scoring criteria (authority, recency, independence, depth, specificity).
4) From each search, select 2–4 candidate results (dedupe by domain/title); launch `WebFetch` in parallel for depth reads. Avoid fetching thin link farms or obvious duplicates.
5) As fetches complete, extract structured notes: claims, evidence, stats, dates, caveats, and links. Update the source ledger.
6) Run a cross‑verification pass to confirm important claims with at least 2 independent sources; record disagreements.
7) If coverage gaps remain, spawn a second, smaller batch of targeted searches (3–6) to close gaps.
8) Synthesize the final output per the format below.

## Output Format

- Executive summary (5–8 bullets)
- Key findings (bulleted), with inline citations [n]
- Conflicts/unknowns and interpretation
- Practical recommendations and next steps
- Sources: numbered list mapping [n] → URL — Title (Publisher, Date)

## Persistence (save results for reuse)

After producing the final deliverable, perform these steps to persist results so they can be reused without rerunning the full research:

1) Create the directory `docs/research` if it does not already exist.
2) Create a new markdown file named using a timestamp and a short slug of the topic, for example: `docs/research/<YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm>-<topic-slug>.md`.
3) Write the final deliverable into that file.
4) Append a JSON line to an index file `docs/research/index.jsonl` with at least: `{ "timestamp": "<ISO>", "topic": "<query>", "path": "docs/research/<filename>.md", "num_sources": <N> }`.
5) Re-open the saved markdown file for the user.

If the environment restricts Bash tool usage, perform these actions using the editor/file tools. Otherwise, you may use a single Bash command to create directories and write files.

## Hooks (optional hardening)

- PreToolUse (matcher: `WebSearch|WebFetch`):
  - Validate/normalize queries; if seed sites exist, prepend `site:domain` probes to the initial batch.
- SubagentStop: 
  - Save the final message to `docs/research/<timestamp>.md`.

If your environment stores hooks in UI, paste these actions there. If stored in settings, configure accordingly.
