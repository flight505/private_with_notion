# About

I am a highly skilled bioinformatics specialist with a PhD from DTU (Technical University of Denmark). My journey in bioinformatics has been driven by a deep passion for genetics, machine learning, and programming, which has equipped me with a robust skill set and a keen eye for innovative solutions.

**Professional Expertise and Contributions:**

During my doctoral studies, I made significant contributions to the ICOPE - Interregional Childhood Oncology Precision Medicine Exploration project. This cutting-edge initiative, a collaboration among prestigious institutions such as the Technical University of Denmark, Lund University, and University Hospital Rigshospitalet, aimed to transform childhood cancer treatment.

In ICOPE, I led the development of state-of-the-art AI and machine learning algorithms designed to analyze complex genetic data. My work facilitated the integration of germline and tumor genetics, biomarker profiling, and pharmacology, providing comprehensive data insights that enhanced diagnostics, clinical treatments, cure rates, and the overall life quality of young cancer patients.
